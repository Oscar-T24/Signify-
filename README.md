### Structure of the CSV : 

`Frame`: id of the frame in the form `a`-`b` where `a` is the frame number and is unique for every recording (sequence of frame or unique frame), and `b` is the frame sub count. 
> For a sequence of frames, `b` gives the number of the jth frame within the `a`sequence
> for a single snapshot, `b` = 0 


`Landmark_ID` : id of the node (see picture from media pipe) identifies part on the hand

`Normalized_X` `Normalized_Y` are the normalized positions of each node (-1,1 on the x-y plane)
